# ELM theme

A VS Code theme with the hope of making it easier for new new developers to identify related elements, attributes, tags, etc. between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Also trying to focus on readability and consideration for accessibility contrast.

Current version: 0.0.2

## Future Plans

1. Continue fleshing out the semantic highlighting for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON.
2. Create a light version of the theme.
3. Expand semantic highlighting for other languages.

## Miscellaneous Stuff

This is my first attempt at creating a theme, so there will be issues. Please feel free to submit an issue so I can take a look at it.
